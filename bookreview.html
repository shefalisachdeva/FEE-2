   <p> Robert Kiyosakis Rich Dad, Poor Dad was in my bookshelf for a long time like an abandoned soul
     finding solace. It took me one whole year to pick up the book and start reading it, and then the 
     game changed. Lots of reviews and suggestions had given me the opinion of Rich Dad, Poor Dad
      as a best self-help books of all time, but since I was someone who is reluctant for self-help
       and more into fiction, I could not possibly have read it. But as soon as I finished the book,
        I regretted it.</p>

            Subtitles of this book quote "What the rich teach their children about money and poor does not".
             Yes, we are usually in the notion that we know all about money. But the truth is that we are all 
             slaves to money and we dont have even 1% knowledge of how money works. Financial literacy is low 
             in todayâ€™s world and most of them do a 9 to 5 job and think they are making money, but infact,
              they are not. This book guides you to that eye-opening fact that we are absolute zero in management 
              of money.
